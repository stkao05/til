# State Updates May Be Asynchronous

React *may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance. Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.

In simpler term...It means you canâ€™t call setState on one line and assume state has changed on the next.

```
setState({ name: "Michael" });
console.log(this.state.name);  // Nope.
```





Common pitfalls: 

```
// At this line, suppose 'this.state.foo' is 5
// When 'setState()` actually occurs, the values
// of this.state.foo might no longer be 5 (i.e. being updated
// by another set state call.
this.setState({foo: this.state.foo + 1 });

// Correct version
this.setState((prevState, props) => {
    return {foo: prevState.foo + 1}
})
```


```
// Capturing values from the state outside of the setState callback.
let previousFoo = this.state.foo;
this.setState((prevState) => {
    // BAD! Setting `foo` based on a potentially outdated
    // view of its current value: `foo` may have been updated
    // in the meantime by another call to `setState`.
    return { ...prevState, foo: previousFoo + 10 };
});

// better version
this.setState((prevState) => {
    return { ...prevState, foo: prevState.foo + 10 };
});
```
